- 👋 Hi, I'm Brittany Ganser. I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio but currently based in Albuquerque, NM. 

- 👀 I received my Bachelor of Arts from Baldwin Wallace University in Theatre with a minor in Web Programming. My love for arts and creating intertwines with the technology field where I can use my creative skills to solve complex problems and present them with confidence.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript at Michigan State Univeristy's Coding Bootcamp expected completed July 2022.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small web projects to practice and hone in my skills as a full stack web developer in training.
