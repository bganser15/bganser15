- 👋 Hi, I'm Brittany Ganser. I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio but currently based in Albuquerque, NM. 

- 👀 I received my Bachelor of Arts from Baldwin Wallace University in Theatre with a minor in Web Programming. My love for arts and creating intertwines with the technology field where I can use my creative skills to solve complex problems and present them with confidence.

- 🌱 I have received my Full Stack Web Development Certificate from Michigan State University with a focus on the MERN Stack. I am currently taking a self paced Web Development course on Udemy to refresh my knowledge and revamp my portfolio.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small web projects to practice and hone in my skills as a full stack web developer. I enjoy creating thoughtful and beautiful UI while mastering behind the scenes.
